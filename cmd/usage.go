message.  This header value ranges between -100.0 and +100.0, with higher
numbers indicating more spam characteristics.

This rspam-classes filter adds an 'X-Spam-Class' header value based on a list
of class names, each associated with a max score value.  Class names may then
be used for message filtering in the email client.

Each email user may customize the classes and thresholds used for their own
account using this email based command interface.  Commands are executed by
sending a message to 'filterctl@your_domain.com' with the command and
arguments as the 'Subject' line.  The message body is ignored.  A reply
message is sent for each command containing output and status.
