Dear Friend,

In the early morning hours of November 2021, I was jolted out of bed by 
banging on my apartment door. I opened my door, wearing only my 
underwear, to see ten FBI agents with a battering ram, guns, and 
blinding white lights.

In front of my neighbors, I was spun around, handcuffed, and thrown 
against the hallway as they breached my home.

When they told me I could call my attorney, I unlocked my phone, only to 
have an FBI agent snatch it from my hands. My confidential sources and 
journalism notes were on my phone, now open to the federal government 
and the Biden Administration.

I was in a complete state of shock, and for years, I lived in fear of 
ending up in a federal prison because I was offered the diary of the 
President's daughter, Ashley Biden.

As I said then, "the process is the punishment," and our federal 
government dictates and controls the process.

*But we are living in new times today.*

Last week, after the FBI closed its investigation related to Ashley 
Biden's diary, a federal judge ordered the FBI to release the search 
warrant materials used against me and my journalists.

The FBI released their documents *but redacted EVERY SINGLE WORD related 
to their probable cause.*

To obtain the search warrant used against me to raid my home and 
confiscate my electronics, the FBI presented “evidence” to a judge to 
obtain the search warrant, *but now, years later and under a new 
administration without the last name "Biden," they want to withhold 
their reasoning.*

*It’s time to hold them accountable 
<https://trk.cpro20.com/click/grih-b977h-ojyfbm-tg6ath1/>, and I've 
decided to move forward with a lawsuit *that will expose the corruption 
of the FBI and the Biden Administration that chose to conduct a terror 
campaign against me and my team of journalists over the diary of 
President Biden’s daughter.

*Will you help me hold them accountable? 
<https://trk.cpro20.com/click/grih-b977h-ojyfbn-tg6ath2/>*

It's a time for Justice, not retaliation. They've been retaliating 
against me since I started exposing the truth.

I've been jailed, sued, and raided. They've used lawfare against me 
relentlessly, along with the terrifying power of the FBI.

Now, it’s our time for Justice and to ensure this never happens again 
under anyone’s watch.

*Help me file a suit today to hold them ALL accountable.
